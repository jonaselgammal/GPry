Progress
========

This module provides the :class:`progress.Progress` class which is used to store
information about the performance of the algorithm (timing, number of GP evaluations,
etc.).

Under normal circumstances you shouldn't have to use any of the methods in here if you use
the :mod:`run` module to run GPry.
