This module uses a Support vector machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel to classify
regions which are "safe" to explore in contrast to regions which are "unsafe"
to explore since they are infinite. This is done in an attempt to hinder the
exploration of parts of the parameter space which have a :math:`-\infty` log-posterior
value. These values need to be filtered out since feeding them to the GP
Regressor will break it. Nevertheless this is important information that we
shouldn't throw away. We will also need the SVM later when doing the MCMC run
to tell the model which regions it shouldn't visit. In essence our process
shrinks the prior to a region where the model thinks that all values of the
log-posterior distribution are finite.

class SVM(SVC):
    r"""
    Wrapper for the sklearn `RBF kernel SVM <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html>`_.

    Classifies points as finite of non-finite, in order to exclude the latter from the
    training set of a parent GPR. It keeps track of the full training set, including
    classified-infinite points.

    The classification is performed using a threshold understood as a positive difference
    against the current maximum ``y`` in the training set. The threshold is passed at
    fitting time and not at initialisation, in case the classifier is defined in a
    transformed coordinate space, with a transformation that changes through the training
    of the parent GPR. (NB: passing the threshold every time is a compromise that allows
    to keep the full training set stored in this object with non-reduced ``y`` values
    while avoiding preprocessing overhead.)

    Also in case there is a coordinate transformation, the training set of this object
    should not be obtained directly, but via properties of the parent GP instead that will
    undo the transformation. The same applying to calling any method directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : float, default=1e7
        Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is
        inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive. The penalty
        is a squared l2 penalty.
    kernel : {'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed'}, default='rbf'
        Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm.
        It must be one of 'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed' or
        a callable.
        If none is given, 'rbf' will be used. If a callable is given it is
        used to pre-compute the kernel matrix from data matrices; that matrix
        should be an array of shape ``(n_samples, n_samples)``.
    degree : int, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly').
        Ignored by all other kernels.
    gamma : {'scale', 'auto'} or float, default='scale'
        Kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.

        * if ``gamma='scale'`` (default) is passed then it uses
          1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma,
        * if 'auto', uses 1 / n_features.

    coef0 : float, default=0.0
        Independent term in kernel function.
        It is only significant in 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.
    shrinking : bool, default=True
        Whether to use the shrinking heuristic.
    probability : bool, default=False
        Whether to enable probability estimates. This must be enabled prior
        to calling `fit`, will slow down that method as it internally uses
        5-fold cross-validation, and `predict_proba` may be inconsistent with
        `predict`.
    tol : float, default=1e-3
        Tolerance for stopping criterion.
    cache_size : float, default=200
        Specify the size of the kernel cache (in MB).
    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Set the parameter C of class i to class_weight[i]*C for
        SVC. If not given, all classes are supposed to have
        weight one.
        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Enable verbose output. Note that this setting takes advantage of a
        per-process runtime setting in libsvm that, if enabled, may not work
        properly in a multithreaded context.
    max_iter : int, default=-1
        Hard limit on iterations within solver, or -1 for no limit.
    decision_function_shape : {'ovo', 'ovr'}, default='ovr'
        Whether to return a one-vs-rest ('ovr') decision function of shape
        (n_samples, n_classes) as all other classifiers, or the original
        one-vs-one ('ovo') decision function of libsvm which has shape
        (n_samples, n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2). However, one-vs-one
        ('ovo') is always used as multi-class strategy. The parameter is
        ignored for binary classification.
    break_ties : bool, default=False
        If true, ``decision_function_shape='ovr'``, and number of classes > 2,
        predict will break ties according to the confidence values of
        decision_function; otherwise the first class among the tied
        classes is returned. Please note that breaking ties comes at a
        relatively high computational cost compared to a simple predict.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the pseudo random number generation for shuffling the data for
        probability estimates. Ignored when `probability` is False.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    Attributes
    ----------
    all_finite : bool
        Is true when all posterior values which have been sampled are finite
        which removes the need for fitting the SVM.
    class_weight_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        Multipliers of parameter C for each class.
        Computed based on the ``class_weight`` parameter.
    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        The classes labels.
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2, n_features)
        Weights assigned to the features (coefficients in the primal
        problem). This is only available in the case of a linear kernel.
        `coef_` is a readonly property derived from `dual_coef_` and
        `support_vectors_`.
    dual_coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes -1, n_SV)
        Dual coefficients of the support vector in the decision
        function, multiplied by
        their targets.
        For multiclass, coefficient for all 1-vs-1 classifiers.
        The layout of the coefficients in the multiclass case is somewhat
        non-trivial.
    fit_status_ : int
        0 if correctly fitted, 1 otherwise (will raise warning)
    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2,)
        Constants in decision function.
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during fit. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
    support_ : ndarray of shape (n_SV)
        Indices of support vectors.
    support_vectors_ : ndarray of shape (n_SV, n_features)
        Support vectors.
    n_support_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,), dtype=int32
        Number of support vectors for each class.
    probA_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2)
    probB_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2)
        If `probability=True`, it corresponds to the parameters learned in
        Platt scaling to produce probability estimates from decision values.
        If `probability=False`, it's an empty array. Platt scaling uses the
        logistic function
        ``1 / (1 + exp(decision_value * probA_ + probB_))``
        where ``probA_`` and ``probB_`` are learned from the dataset..
    shape_fit_ : tuple of int of shape (n_dimensions_of_X,)
        Array dimensions of training vector ``X``.
